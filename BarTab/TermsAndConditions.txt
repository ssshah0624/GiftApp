Binding Arbitration and Applicable Law (Continued from Section titled “Binding Arbitration” above)
Arbitration shall be conducted by and submitted to a single arbitrator (“Arbitrator”) selected from and administered by the Orange, California ofﬁce of JAMS (“JAMS”), in accordance with its then-existing Comprehensive Arbitration Rules & Procedures. The Arbitrator shall be authorized to award compensatory damages, but shall NOT be authorized to award non-economoc damages such as for emotional distress, or pain and suffering or punitive or indirect, incidental or consequential damages. Each party shall bear its own attorneys’ fees, cost and disbursements arising out of the arbitration, and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the Arbitrator and JAMS; however, the Arbitrator may award to the prevailing party reimbursement of its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs (including, for example, expert witness fees and travel expenses), and/or the fees and costs of the Arbitrator. Within ﬁfteen (15) calendar days after conclusion of the arbitration, the Arbitrator shall issue a written award and a written statement of decision describing the material factual ﬁndings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. Each party shall fully perform and satisfy the arbitration award within ﬁfteen (15) days of the service of the award. Judgment on the award may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction. By agreeing to this binding arbitration provision, you understand that you are waiving certain rights and protections which may otherwise be available if a claim or dispute were determined by litigation in court, including, without limitation, the right to seek or obtain certain types of damages precluded by this arbitration provision, the right to a jury trial, certain rights of appeal, the right bring a claim as a class member in any purported class or representative proceeding, and the right to invoke formal rules of procedure and evidence.

THE PRE-DISPUTE ARBITRATION CLAUSE IN THE AGREEMENTS PROVIDES FOR DISPUTE RESOLUTION SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY REGULATORY AUTHORITY. YOU FURTHER AGREE THAT, IF YOU DECIDE TO OPEN AN ACCOUNT IN THE PROGRAM, THE PRE-DISPUTE ARBITRATION CLAUSE IN THE AGREEMENTS SUPERSEDES THE ARBITRATION PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS OF USE.

Interpretation
If any part of these Terms of Use is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations contained herein, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of the Terms of Use shall continue in effect.

The Services, Content, other technology we may make available, and derivatives thereof may be subject to laws and regulations of the United States and other jurisdictions. No forbearance or delay by either party in enforcing its rights shall prejudice or restrict the rights of that party, and no waiver of any such rights or of any breach of any contractual terms shall be deemed to be a waiver of any other right or of any later breach. You may not assign any of your rights or obligations hereunder, whether by operation of law or otherwise. We may assign our rights and privileges under these Terms of Use (including your user registration), without your consent in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or to an afﬁliate, or in connection with a change in control. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms of Use shall bind and inure to the beneﬁt of the parties, their respective successors and permitted assigns.
